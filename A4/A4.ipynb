    "The purpose of this assignment is to understand the terminology and object naming conventions used for mechanical components such as pipes, radiators,\n",
    "and air handling units (AHUs) in Blender, and to compare these with the corresponding terms and structures used in OpenShell.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the components are not always consistently named in Blender,as the naming can vary depending on how the model has been structured.\n",
    "In some cases, elements such as pipes, radiators, or AHUs may be defined as generic or non-specific objects.\n",
    "As a result, they cannot be easily identified or accessed through Python scripting,\n",
    "which can complicate the process of linking or manipulating these elements within the MEP model.\n",

    "The following code examples demonstrate different methods for checking MEP elements."
