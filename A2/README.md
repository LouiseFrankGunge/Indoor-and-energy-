**A2b: Identify Claim**

Select building: 25-06-D-MEP

Claim: Critical path analysis of the pressure loss (page 25)

Description: We are testing if the claim about the critical presurre loss for the different AHU. By calling the differnet ducts that together form the most critical path.

**A2c: Use Case**

In the BPMN it is shown how we would check the claim, when and the phases that would be required to do in order to check the claim.

**A2d: Scope the use case**

**A2e: Tool Idea**

Based on the attachments where the pressure loss has been calculated, the different ducts used to determine the most critical pressure loss is described. So the idea is, that it would be possible to identify the individual ducts and their known values such as length and diameter, to calculate the critical pressure loss and then check whether it matches what is stated in the report.

**A2f: Information Requirements**
