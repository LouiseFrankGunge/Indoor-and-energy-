# Group 18 - Reflections

This reflections is based on the course as a total and the processes and out comes of the following 3 assignments:

**A3 Tool**

Learning Experience

•	When starting this course, I had some prior knowledge of the concept of openBIM from having taken the introductory openBIM course. That said, the approach to how openBIM can be used is very different in the two courses. Therefore, I feel like I am missing some foundational theory on how to develop tools and how an IFC file is structured.

•	If/when openBIM becomes integrated into the building sector, using it as a means to deliver information to, for example, contractors seems very likely to me.

Process of Developing the Tutorial

•	The course encouraged some initial consideration of potential thesis topics, but none of these thoughts have developed further yet.

•	The freedom we were given regarding use cases allowed us to be creative during the tool-development process. However, some additional structure and clearer information about the criteria would have benefited the work. There was a lot of uncertainty for everybody in our focus area, and as managers we felt we should have had more practical information in order to support the other groups, but this was difficult to obtain. This made the process more frustrating than necessary.

•	The number of tools required was fine.

Future for Advanced Use of OpenBIM

•	Using openBIM tools in my thesis is quite likely, as there is still significant potential for development and exploration. However, it is still unclear to me exactly how I will be able to incorporate it.

•	Using openBIM in my professional career also seems possible, but many factors influence this. The building sector will need to change its approach more rapidly, and many of the openBIM software solutions available today still require substantial improvement before I would consider them reliable.

Wrap-Up

The initial assignment in this course was a great lead-up to developing the BIM tool. It provided a good starting point for working with the different tools. Assignment A2 was difficult to begin because I felt more introduction was needed. The process of deciding on the use case and analysing previous Advanced Building Design projects made sense, but creating the IDM diagram was confusing for someone who had never made one before. For example, the required level of detail was unclear to me.
Going into A4, the uncertainty from A3 made the process difficult to navigate. For me, this resulted in a somewhat uneven learning curve. Normally, the uncertainty surrounding a subject fades in the beginning, but in this case, it felt like more uncertainty arose throughout the development of A3 and A4. As a result, the learning curve became very individual and varied.

**Feedback from other groups**

The feedback we received consisted mainly of questions. One of them asked whether it is possible to use a script to determine if elements are connected. This is not possible due to the way the Revit files were exported to IFC. This issue is explained in more detail in our A3, where it is also stated that we had to pevit our use case, and that we think out tool i stage C and stage D.
