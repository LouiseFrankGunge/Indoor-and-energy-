# Group 18 - Reflections

This reflections is based on the course as a total and the processes and out comes of the following 3 assignments:

Learning Experience

•	When starting this course, I had some prior knowledge of the concept of openBIM from having taken the introductory openBIM course. That said, the approach to how openBIM can be used is very different in the two courses. Therefore, I feel like I am missing some foundational theory on how to develop tools and how an IFC file is structured.

•	If/when openBIM becomes integrated into the building sector, using it as a means to deliver information to, for example, contractors seems very likely to me.

Process of Developing the Tutorial

•	The course encouraged some initial consideration of potential thesis topics, but none of these thoughts have developed further yet.

•	The freedom we were given regarding use cases allowed us to be creative during the tool-development process. However, some additional structure and clearer information about the criteria would have benefited the work. There was a lot of uncertainty for everybody in our focus area, and as managers we felt we should have had more practical information in order to support the other groups, but this was difficult to obtain. This made the process more frustrating than necessary.

•	The number of tools required was fine.

Future for Advanced Use of OpenBIM

•	Using openBIM tools in my thesis is quite likely, as there is still significant potential for development and exploration. However, it is still unclear to me exactly how I will be able to incorporate it.

•	Using openBIM in my professional career also seems possible, but many factors influence this. The building sector will need to change its approach more rapidly, and many of the openBIM software solutions available today still require substantial improvement before I would consider them reliable.

Wrap-Up

The initial assignment in this course was a great lead-up to developing the BIM tool. It provided a good starting point for working with the different tools. Assignment A2 was difficult to begin because I felt more introduction was needed. The process of deciding on the use case and analysing previous Advanced Building Design projects made sense, but creating the IDM diagram was confusing for someone who had never made one before. For example, the required level of detail was unclear to me.
Going into A4, the uncertainty from A3 made the process difficult to navigate. For me, this resulted in a somewhat uneven learning curve. Normally, the uncertainty surrounding a subject fades in the beginning, but in this case, it felt like more uncertainty arose throughout the development of A3 and A4. As a result, the learning curve became very individual and varied.

Learning experience 

-	I feel like there is still a lot you can learn about the concept of OpenBIM, but I also feel that I have learned a lot in the course, especially because my knowledge before starting was mainly limited to working in OpenBIM and not using it to get information.
  
-	In the future, when working with models in OpenBIM, I will use what I have learned in this course to more easily retrieve the information I need and ensure that I export the required data correctly.
  
Your process of developing the tutorial

-	I have not formulated specific thesis questions yet, but the course has definitely set some ideas in motion and given me a clearer sense of potential directions.
  
-	I appreciated having freedom in choosing the use case. It allowed for creativity and made it easier to pivot if the original tool concept did not work, while still staying within the scope of the use case. However, the expectations regarding the use case developed by the managers could have been a bit clearer.
  
-	I found the number of tools in the course fine. 

Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

-	I will likely use some form of OpenBIM in my thesis. I’m not sure how yet, but maybe to handle results more efficiently.
  
-	I find digital design tools interesting, so I think there is a strong possibility that I will still be working with OpenBIM in ten years.

Wrap up

-	Throughout the course, there has generally been a strong connection between the assignments, each building on previous concepts and ideas. In the first assignment, you gain an understanding of what OpenBIM can be used for and how to create simple scripts. In Assignment 2, it made sense to further develop your idea and add more complexity. However, the second part of Assignment 2, the flowchart, was somewhat confusing, particularly regarding what it should include and how it connected to the rest of the assignment. Assignments 3 and 4 followed naturally, but the purpose of the tutorial in Assignment 4 was not entirely clear, which reduced its connection to the previous tasks.

Learning experience 

-  Even though I had a previous OpenBIM course, I still felt I lacked practical knowledge about how to use the tools to share information. This course offered a different perspective and showed new ways of retrieving information. However, I still feel that there is a lot more to learn and that I am missing some fundamental aspects of OpenBIM

-  In the future I imagine that OpenBIM could be very useful for me in order to retrieve information from IFC models  

Your process of developing the tutorial

-  Due to the freedom in the assignment, it was sometimes unclear whether or not we were going in the right direction or meeting the expectations of the assignment, therefore a few more guidelines would have been nice. However, the room the assignment gave for creativity was also appreciated and resulted in many interesting tools.

-  The number of tools in the course was fine

Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

-  As of now it is likely that I will use OpenBIM in my thesis, however I do think it will be to a small degree.

-  I think it is very likely that OpenBIM will become part of my professional life in the next 10 years, as I can see it being a useful tool in many areas of the industry that interest me.

Wrap up

-  The assignments throughout the course had a natural progression, with each assignment building on what was done and learned in the previous one. The first assignment also worked as a good introduction to the use of ifcopenshell in python. However, the role as the manager of the group was also quite confusing in the beginning. Assignment 2 would have benefitted from an introduction, as creating the flowchart was somewhat confusing. Assignment 3 and 4 followed each other well, but there was some uncertainty carried over from A3 to A4. 
 

**Feedback from other groups**

The feedback we received consisted mainly of questions. One of them asked whether it is possible to use a script to determine if elements are connected. This is not possible due to the way the Revit files were exported to IFC. This issue is explained in more detail in our A3, where it is also stated that we had to pevit our use case, and that we think out tool i stage C and stage D.
